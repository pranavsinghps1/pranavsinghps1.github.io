title: Semantic Parsing Survey
permalink: /survey/
---

Here is a literature survey I had done on the topic of semantic parsing. It is in no way fully complete but I have tried to touch on some of the note worthy papers and transitions in the field over time. You can also [download the PDF here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uy9iuwhddbeoz9t/Semantic_parsing_survey_akbc.pdf?dl=0).
