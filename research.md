I hope to make a page each for my projects, explaining the aim, intuition behind the approach and the results in a way that can be understood by someone reading the material for the first time. 
I believe that explaining what you understand, in the easiest manner possible is super helpful to others who might be attempting to solve similar problems. I myself find it very helpful to read the blogs of Andrej Karpathy or Cristopher Olah, and the ease of understanding from their posts is quite extraordinary. Hopefully some day I will be able to explain things as well as them!
